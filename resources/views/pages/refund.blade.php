                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Orders once placed through Jollof.com may not be cancelled or refunded. Under an
                                exceptional circumstance of a cancellation of order as permitted above, Jollof.com will
                                refund the changed amount for the same after deducting valid transaction charges of 5%

                            <li>Estimated Delivery Time displayed on the website is the approximate time the vendor will
                                take to deliver the item(s) to the Customer. In the event of any delay or default in
                                such delivery, Jollof.com shall in no event or circumstances be held liable or
                                responsible for the same, and the Outlet shall be directly liable and responsible for
                                all the consequences of the same. Cancellations and refunds for orders that are
                                delivered outside of the estimated delivery time will be at the sole discretion of the
                                vendor.</li>

                            <li>In the event the Customer is dissatisfied with the quality of the item(s), the Customer
                                shall not be entitled to seek cancellation or refund of the billed amounts. However, if
                                there is any shortfall in delivery or the item(s) such as they had spilled or were
                                damaged, the Customer shall at the time of delivery return the item(s) to the Dispatcher
                                with a written complaint of the same on the Bill against signature of the Dispatcher.
                                Moreover, in the event of any shortfall in delivery of the item(s) having spilled or
                                being damaged, the Customer shall inform Jollof.com of the same within 24 hours.
                                Jollof.com shall thereafter initiate investigations in the matter of complaint received
                                and shall make reasonable efforts to complete such investigation within a period of
                                thirty days from the date of such commencement. The decision of Jollof.com on completion
                                of such investigation shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Customer and the
                                customer shall not dispute the same.</li>
